# BanItems
Ban Items, Equipment, Lunar items from RoR2 multiplayer games

Ryan has released a superior/more interoperable version which does more or less the same thing, but using builtin functionality with a very nice ingame UI. I highly suggest visitng: https://thunderstore.io/package/RyanPallesen/ItemBlacklister/ to check it out.
If however you are looking for preferences to persist between runs, and for other lobby members to not have a vote on which items get blacklisted, this mod will suffice.

Place inside of Ror2\Bepinex\plugins\

Clients do not need to install this mod. Only the host.

Configure Ror2\Bepinex\config\com.Paddywan.BanItem.cfg and set to true to disable specific items / equipment from dropping.
